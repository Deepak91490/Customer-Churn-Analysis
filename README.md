## Key Insights

- The overall churn rate for the last month was **27%** (1,869 out of 7,043 customers).
- **Contract type and customer tenure** are critical churn predictors. Monthly contracts and low tenure customers show higher churn risk.
- **Customers without dependents or partners** are more likely to churn.
- **Gender** has no significant impact, while **senior citizens** are less prone to churn.
- **Fibre Optic internet service users** have a higher churn rate compared to other internet services.
- Customers paying via **Electronic check** showed the highest churn rates.
- Lack of services like **Tech Support, Device Protection, and Online Security** increases churn likelihood.

## Recommendations

- **Extend contract durations** from 1 month to 3 or 6 months to encourage longer customer retention.
- **Target single customers** with attractive deals and loyalty programs under a **‘Catch them Young’ strategy**.
- **Bundle essential services** like Tech Support, Device Protection, and Online Security with standard plans to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
